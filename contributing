Contributions are welcome.

Suppose you want to add a new container named "xyz" to this repository. We
would like to encourage you to add a folder named xyz to build your container
publicly. In the xyz folder, you can specify your container via a Dockerfile
(or equivalent). To build the container, add a github actions workflow under
.github/workflows named xyz.yaml. Name the image "containers-xyz", and have
the workflow act only on the files added (folder xyz and workflow file). Also,
tag and release the container with xyz-1.2.3.

See the example provided by the ghci container.
